## üéØ Objectives

This project has two main goals:

- ‚úÖ Identify the **key success factors** behind popular or high-selling games  
- ‚úÖ Perform a **comprehensive market analysis**, both global and segmented

---

## üñºÔ∏è Project Scope

- Use **PySpark** and **Databricks** for data exploration and analysis
- Create interactive visualizations using **Databricks' dashboard tool**
- Work with a **semi-structured JSON dataset**, hosted on an S3 bucket: s3://full-stack-bigdata-datasets/Big_Data/Project_Steam/steam_game_output.json
  
---

## üîç Summary of the Approach

The project was carried out in the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**
   - Connection to the S3 bucket and reading of the JSON file using PySpark.
   - Analysis of the semi-structured schema, including nested fields.

2. **Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Use of `explode()` to flatten complex, nested columns.
   - Selection and transformation of relevant columns (dates, text, prices, reviews, etc.).
   - Handling of null values and duplicates.

3. **Creation of Specific DataFrames**
   - Splitting the main dataset into logical subgroups:
     - Publisher data  
     - Genre data  
     - Platform data  
     - Pricing and review data  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Use of Spark functions such as `groupBy`, `agg`, `withColumn`, etc.
   - Visualizations created in Databricks to:
     - Explore trends (by year, price, genre, etc.)
     - Identify popular games or dominant genres
     - Highlight key publishers and major platforms

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identification of factors impacting popularity (ratings, pricing, genres, etc.)
   - Key recommendations formulated for Ubisoft based on data findings
